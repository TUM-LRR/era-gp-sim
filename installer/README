We use the Qt-Installer Framework for the installer.
Prerequisites:

+ Download the prebuilt framework (https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt-installer-framework/2.0.3/)
  The os name in the framework specifies for which os the installer is generated

Naming convention: erasim-<version>-<platform> (e.g. erasim-0.9.0-linux)

Note: for zipping you can use archivegen <file to zip> <output name> from the framework
