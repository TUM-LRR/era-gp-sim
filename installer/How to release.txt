We use the Qt-Installer Framework for the installer.
Prerequisites:

+ Download the prebuilt framework (https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt-installer-framework/2.0.3/)
  The os name in the framework specifies for which os the installer is generated

+ Install 7zip command line utility
  Linux: packages "p7zip-full" and "p7zip-rar"

  If you cannot install a 7zip utility, this is fine. The automated scripts won't work though


The general steps to do:
* Build an new clean version of era-sim
* Zip era-sim executable and isa-Folder into packages/erasim.base/data/<archive name>.7z
* Zip .erasim, put the archive into packages/erasim.config/data/<archive name>.7z
* Call the binarycreator-tool of the downloaded prebuilt framework:
  <path_from_here_to_binary_creator>/binarycreator -c config/config.xml -p packages <Output file name>
* Remove the zipped data packages


Release script:
Linux:
	call linux_release.sh <path_to_binary_creator> <cmake prefix path> <Output file name>
	Note: The installscript puts the output file into the releases folder
