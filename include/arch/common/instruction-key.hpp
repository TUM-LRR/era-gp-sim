/**
 * Identifies an instruction in an ISA.
 *
 * It is naive to think that an instruction is identified uniquely through its
 * opcode alone. In RISC-V, the opcode is a quite general *instruction group*
 * identifier. For example, all load operations and all store operations have
 * the same opcode. Next to the opcode, almost all instructions have *function
 * bits*, which further specialize an instruction. For example, for loads, the
 * instructions for load operations of different sizes (`LH`, `LD`) have the
 * same opcode, but different function bits (in this case referred to as the
 * `width`). These bits would tell the decoder the width and sign of the data to
 * load (and analogously, store, for `S[BHWD][U]`). It is thus necessary to
 * identify instructions through a tuple of keys. In practice, having different
 * fixed-size key arrays for different instruction types would be infeasible or
 * impossible (you would need to derive different subclasses with new members,
 * but then polymorphism wouldn't work anyway). Rather, the solution
 * is to use a hashmap, mapping key names to key values. A key name would be,
 * for example, the "opcode", "function bits", "format bits" for floating point
 * instructions. The values would be the respective key values, i.e. the numeric
 * values of the bit sequences for the given key. For example, this would mean
 * the value `0b000 = 0` for the width bits of load instructions in RISC-V when
 * the instruction is `LB`, or `0b001 = 1` for `LH` (16-bit halfword).
 *
 * Every instruction key must have at least one entry named "opcode".
